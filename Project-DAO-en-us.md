## **EthicAI DAO Project**

### 1. **DAO Name**:  
**EthicAI DAO**  
(The name can be changed if needed, but this suggestion highlights the focus on ethical AI and control)

### 2. **Mission Statement**:  
The **EthicAI DAO** aims to foster, fund, and organize studies, debates, and seminars on the problem of AI control. Our goal is to promote the development of ethical, secure, and transparent solutions to ensure that AI benefits all of humanity, balancing innovation with responsibility.

### 3. **DAO Deliverables for Society**:  
The **EthicAI DAO** aims to deliver:  
- **Funded and published research** on AI control, discussing technical, ethical, and philosophical aspects.
- **Debates and seminars** with experts in AI, ethics, law, and philosophy, open to the public to raise awareness.
- **Concrete proposals for regulators** on how to supervise and ensure AI development adheres to ethical and safety standards.
- **Educational initiatives** through educational content and programs that help both the public and experts understand the risks and benefits of AI.

### 4. **Actions for DAO Implementation**:

#### 4.1 **Creation of digital infrastructure**:
   - **Create a Discord server**:  
     Set up a Discord server as the main communication and collaboration hub for DAO members. The server will be divided into channels for various topics, such as technical discussions, philosophical debates, governance, and project coordination.
     
   - **Create social media accounts (X and Instagram)**:  
     Create official DAO profiles on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram to promote DAO activities, share updates on seminars, research, and funding, and engage with the broader community.
     
   - **Official EthicAI DAO website**:  
     A website to publish official content, such as articles, research results, event calendars, and open governance information.

#### 4.2 **Invite members and collaborators**:
   - **Invite campaign**:  
     Conduct a recruitment and awareness campaign on social media and in AI, ethics, philosophy, and tech communities to invite experts, academics, and enthusiasts to join the DAO.
   - **Partnerships with research institutions**:  
     Connect with universities and research centers for collaboration and active participation in discussions.

#### 4.3 **Launch Governance Token**:  
   - **EthicAI Token (EAI)**:  
     Create a governance token that will allow members to vote on major DAO decisions, such as approval of research to be funded, events to be organized, strategic partnerships, and more.
     
#### 4.4 **Funding Mechanisms**:
   - **Token-based funding**:  
     Create a smart contract for resource gathering, allowing members to purchase EthicAI Tokens, which can be used for governance and participation in projects.
     
   - **Partnerships with investors and grants**:  
     Seek partnerships with investors focused on ethical and technological innovation. We can also apply for grants from foundations that fund research and projects in ethical AI.
     
   - **Crowdfunding for seminars and events**:  
     Launch crowdfunding campaigns to finance seminars and specific projects focused on AI safety and control.
     
#### 4.5 **Configuration of Voting and Governance Tools**:
   - **Snapshot (or similar tool)**:  
     Set up Snapshot or another decentralized governance tool for voting on proposals, determining how funds will be allocated, approving events, and organizing working groups within the DAO. Snapshot allows integration with governance tokens and facilitates the decision-making process.

#### 4.6 **Legal and Organizational Registration**:
   - **Create an LLC or register with CNPq**:  
     Assess whether creating an LLC (Limited Liability Company) would be advantageous for the DAO, providing a recognized legal status to enter into contracts and agreements. However, since the primary focus is research, registering as a study and research group with CNPq might be more appropriate, offering institutional recognition in Brazil and facilitating access to academic collaborations and public funding.

#### 4.7 **Foster public debate on AI**:
   - **Publications and lectures**:  
     Regularly publish articles and studies on the DAO's website and academic platforms, and organize public online lectures to increase public engagement.
     
   - **Critical thinking workshops**:  
     As part of the mission to raise awareness, organize workshops that connect technical aspects of AI with philosophy and ethics, helping to create an informed community concerned with the impact of AI on society.
